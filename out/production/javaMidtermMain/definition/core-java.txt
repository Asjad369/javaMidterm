that a specific java program needs to run.
-java interpreter is a computer program that implements JVM. it is responsible for reading and executing the program.
-java compiler is a program that takes the text file work of a developer and compiles it into a platform-independent
java file.

What is an IDE?
Answer: An integrated development environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer
programmers. IDE's can perform variety of functions like write code, compile code, debug code etc.

What are some of the most popular Java IDEs available in the market?

Explain the entire java life cycle.
Answer: first you type the program in text editor and save it as a java extension. 2nd step is compiling and once you
give that java extension file to compiler it will turn the text into bytecode which is not readable by human and the
output file will have class extension. last step is execution, the bytecode generated by the compiler will be executed
by JVM.

What is a class?
Answer: Class ia blueprint which is used to create objects and to define object data types and method.

What is an object?
Answer: A Java object is a combination of data and procedures working on the available data. ... The state of an object
 is stored in fields (variables), while methods (functions) display the object's behavior

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
Answer: An abstract class allows you to create functionality that subclasses can implement or override. An interface
only allows you to define functionality, not implement it. And whereas a class can extend only one abstract class, it
can take advantage of multiple interfaces.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class? If yes or no, how would you do it?
Answer: You cannot create an object of abstract class or interface since they are incomplete class. What you can do is
to implement a subclass of abstract class which, of course, must not be abstract.

What is Access Modifier?
Answer: Access modifiers are keywords in object-oriented languages that set the accessibility of classes, methods, and
 other members

What is OOP? Define each OOP concept.
Answer: Object-Oriented Programming System (OOPs) is a programming concept that works on the principles of abstraction,
encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. It allows users to create objects they want and create methods to handle
those objects.
-Abstraction:Abstraction is one of the OOP Concepts in Java which is an act of representing essential features without
including background details
-Encapsulation:Encapsulation is one of the best Java OOPs concepts of wrapping the data and code. In this OOPs concept,
the variables of a class are always hidden from other classes.
-Inheritance:Inheritance is one of the Basic Concepts of OOPs in which one object acquires the properties and behaviors
of the parent object.
-Polymorphism: Polymorphism refers to one of the OOPs concepts in Java which is the ability of a variable, object or
function to take on multiple forms.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?

Answer: An application programming interface is a connection between computers or between computer programs. IntelliJ.

Does java support multiple inheritance? Why or why not?
Answer:Java supports multiple inheritance through interfaces only. A class can implement any number of interfaces but
can extend only one class. Multiple inheritance is not supported because it leads to deadly diamond problem

What is method overloading and when does it happen?
Answer:Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters. Must
 have at least two methods by the same name in the class. Must have a different number of parameters

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle them.
Answer:exceptions is an event that disrupts the flow of the program. The try-catch is the simplest method of handling
exceptions. Put the code you want to run in the try block, and any Java exceptions that the code throws are caught by
one or more catch blocks

What is static keyword? When and how do we use it?
Answer:In Java, static keyword is mainly used for memory management. It can be used with variables, methods, blocks and
nested classes. It is a keyword which is used to share the same variable or method of a given class. Basically, static
is used for a constant variable or a method that is same for every instance of a class

What is final keyword? When and how do we use it?
Answer:Java final keyword is a non-access specifier that is used to restrict a class, variable, and method. If we
initialize a variable with the final keyword, then we cannot modify its value. If we declare a method as final, then it
cannot be overridden by any subclasses.

Explain the difference between final, finally and finalize?
Answer:The basic difference between final, finally and finalize is that the final is an access modifier, finally is the
block in Exception Handling and finalize is the method of object class

What is a constructor?
Answer:A constructor in Java is a block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object is
created. A constructor doesn't have a return type. The name of the constructor must be the same as the name of the class

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
Answer:The technique of having two (or more) constructors in a class is known as constructor overloading. A class can
have multiple constructors that differ in the number and/or type of their parameters

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
Answer:All classes have at least one constructor. If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java compiler
automatically provides a no-argument constructor, called the default constructor.

What is "this" keyword in Java? When would we use it?
Answer:This keyword refers to the current object in a method or constructor. The most common use of this keyword
 is to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and parameters with the same name

What is "super" keyword in Java? What are some scenarios we would use it?
Answer: super can be used to invoke immediate parent class method.

Answer: yes its automatic.

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
Answer:Java Heap Space is used throughout the application, but Stack is only used for the method — or methods —
currently running. The Heap Space contains all objects are created, but Stack contains any reference to those objects.
