***ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS BELOW***

Why do we need data structure?
Answer: data structures helps us with organizing, managing, and storing data efficiently.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different data structures?
Answer:insertion, deletion, searching, sorting

When would we use data structures in the real world?
Answer: when you do not know the size of data.

What is an Array?
Answer:
An array is a data structure that contains a group of elements. Typically these elements are all of the same data type,
such as an integer or string

What is the difference between Array and ArrayList?
Answer:array members are accessed using [], while ArrayList has a set of methods to access elements and modify them.
 Array is a fixed size data structure while ArrayList is not.

What is a LinkedList?
Answer:
Linked lists are linear data structures that hold data in individual objects called nodes. These nodes hold both the
data and a reference to the next node in the list.

How is an Array different from LinkedList?
Answer:An array is a collection of elements of a similar data type. A linked list is a collection of objects known as a
 node where node consists of two parts, i.e., data and address. Array elements store in a contiguous memory location.

What is a Queue?
Answer: queue is a line first come first out.

What is a Stack (not Java memory - refers to data structure)?
Answer: stack is a pile of data and the way it works is last in first out.

What is FIFO and LIFO?
Answer: first in first out, last in first out.

Explain Big O Notation?
Answer: we use for talking about how long an algorithm takes to run or how much memory is used by algorithm,

What is the best case to search an element from an array?
Answer:  linear search is the best because it has to parse through data and allighn it.

What is the worst case to search an element from an array?
Answer: the worst case when o(n^2) because you are comparing all the elements with each other.

Describe what a tree data structure is?
Answer:A tree is a hierarchical data structure defined as a collection of nodes. Nodes represent value and nodes are
connected by edges. ... The tree originates from this, and hence it does not have any parent. Each node has one parent
only but can have multiple children.

Describe what a graph data structure is?
Answer:A Graph in the data structure can be termed as a data structure consisting of data that is stored among many
groups of edges(paths) and vertices (nodes), which are interconnected
